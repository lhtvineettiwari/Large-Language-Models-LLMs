## Introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational machine learning models that use `deep learning algorithms` to process and understand `natural language`. These models are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patterns and entity relationships in the language. LLMs can perform many types of language tasks, such as translating languages, analyzing sentiments, chatbot conversations, and more. They can understand complex textual data, identify entities and relationships between them, and generate new text that is coherent and grammatically accurate.

## Fine-tuning Model

Fine-tuning is a technique in machine learning that involves taking a `pre-trained model`, such as a language model or an image classifier, and `training` it on a `new task` with a `small amount of additional data`.

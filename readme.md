## Introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational machine learning models that use `deep learning algorithms` to process and understand `natural language`. These models are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patterns and entity relationships in the language. LLMs can perform many types of language tasks, such as translating languages, analyzing sentiments, chatbot conversations, and more. They can understand complex textual data, identify entities and relationships between them, and generate new text that is coherent and grammatically accurate.

## Fine-tuning Model

Fine-tuning is a technique in machine learning that involves taking a `pre-trained model`, such as a language model or an image classifier, and `training` it on a `new task` with a `small amount of additional data`.

## What is a pre-trained model

A pre-trained model is a `machine learning model` that has already been trained on a `large dataset` and can be used as a starting point for a new task without being trained from scratch.

The pre-training process involves using `unsupervised` learning techniques, such as `self-supervised` learning or `transfer learning`, to learn general features or representations from large amounts of data.

#### Why use pre-trained model 
Pre-trained models have become popular in machine learning because they can save significant `time and computational resources`. Instead of training a model from scratch, a pre-trained model can be used as a `starting point`, reducing the amount of training required to achieve good performance on a specific task. Pre-trained models have been developed for a variety of machine learning tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and more.
